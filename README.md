# Intermittent Empty FlatList in React Native

This repository demonstrates a bug where a FlatList component in React Native intermittently renders empty when fetching data from an API, even if the API request is successful.  The issue is inconsistent; sometimes data renders correctly, other times the list remains empty.

## Bug Description

A React Native application fetches data from a remote API to populate a FlatList.  Under normal circumstances, the data should correctly populate the list. However, intermittently, the list remains blank, despite the API returning data and no apparent errors being thrown.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run the application on a React Native simulator or device.
3. Observe that the FlatList sometimes renders the data and sometimes does not.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring that the data fetched from the API is correctly processed and handled within the state management of the component.
